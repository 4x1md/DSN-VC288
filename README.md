# DSN-VC288
This contains all of my data from KiCAD related to the VSN-VC288 Voltmeter. There are 2 versions of this circuit schematic. 
The first,V1.x, was made using a similar general layout as the back side of the PBC itself. The second, V2.x, was created with
blocks and labels for a more traditional top to bottom left to right flow that I find easier to understand. I have not used an
entirely conventional structure or nomenclature. I prefer a mix that I find more intuitive. I am uploading the files here so that
anyone can modify them as they see fit.
